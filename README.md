# Vencura

Vencura is a safe and reliable financial service for multiple wallets, for users with all levels of web3 knowledge.

It was developed in React using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Stack

- React
- Typescript
- Next

1. install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

1. rename `.env-sample` to `.env`

1. run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

## Vencura set up

It symply requires a login through a wallet, email or metamask account and a custodial ETH wallet will be automatically created

## Vencura features

- see your current balance
- sign a message through ETH blockchain
- send transaction to a wallet address
- see transaction history and its status

## Notes

- since the objective is to handle custodial wallets on the backend, the front-end is a little bit funky
